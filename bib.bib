    ABSTRACT = {Machine learning is an expanding field with an ever-increasing role in everyday life, with its utility in the industrial, agricultural, and medical sectors being undeniable. Recently, this utility has come in the form of machine learning implementation on embedded system devices. While there have been steady advances in the performance, memory, and power consumption of embedded devices, most machine learning algorithms still have a very high power consumption and computational demand, making the implementation of embedded machine learning somewhat difficult. However, different devices can be implemented for different applications based on their overall processing power and performance. This paper presents an overview of several different implementations of machine learning on embedded systems divided by their specific device, application, specific machine learning algorithm, and sensors. We will mainly focus on NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi devices with a few different less utilized embedded computers, as well as which of these devices were more commonly used for specific applications in different fields. We will also briefly analyze the specific ML models most commonly implemented on the devices and the specific sensors that were used to gather input from the field. All of the papers included in this review were selected using Google Scholar and published papers in the IEEExplore database. The selection criterion for these papers was the usage of embedded computing systems in either a theoretical study or practical implementation of machine learning models. The papers needed to have provided either one or, preferably, all of the following results in their studies—the overall accuracy of the models on the system, the overall power consumption of the embedded machine learning system, and the inference time of their models on the embedded system. Embedded machine learning is experiencing an explosion in both scale and scope, both due to advances in system performance and machine learning models, as well as greater affordability and accessibility of both. Improvements are noted in quality, power usage, and effectiveness.},

ABSTRACT = {The interoperations of endpoint devices are generally achieved by gateways in Internet of Things (IoT) systems. However, the gateways mainly focus on networking communication, which is lack of data logic control capabilities. The microcontrollers with embedded intelligence could work as an intermediate device to help the interconnections of the endpoint devices. Moreover, they could help control the endpoint devices. In this paper, a microcontroller architecture with intelligent and scalable characteristics is proposed. The intelligence means that the microcontroller could control the target endpoint devices by its logical circuits, and the scalability means that the microcontroller architecture could be easily extended to deal with more complex problems. Two real world industrial implementations of the proposed architecture are introduced. The implementations show that the microcontroller is important to provide the intelligent services to users in IoT systems. Furthermore, a simulation experiment based on the cloud model is designed to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the edge is the utilization of AI in real-world devices. Edge AI refers to the practice of doing AI computations near the users at the network's edge, instead of centralised location like a cloud service provider's data centre. With the latest innovations in AI efficiency, the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and the rise of edge computing, the potential of edge AI has now been unlocked. This study provides a thorough analysis of AI approaches and capabilities as they pertain to edge computing, or Edge AI. Further, a detailed survey of edge computing and its paradigms including transition to Edge AI is presented to explore the background of each variant proposed for implementing Edge Computing. Furthermore, we discussed the Edge AI approach to deploying AI algorithms and models on edge devices, which are typically resource-constrained devices located at the edge of the network. We also presented the technology used in various modern IoT applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare, and surveillance. Moreover, the discussion of leveraging machine learning algorithms optimized for resource-constrained environments is presented. Finally, important open challenges and potential research directions in the field of edge computing and edge AI have been identified and investigated. We hope that this article will serve as a common goal for a future blueprint that will unite important stakeholders and facilitates to accelerate development in the field of Edge AI.}
